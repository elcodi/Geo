# Model layer

The model for this component adds all the tools needed to manage geo location,
these tools are the following

## Location

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Entity/Location.php)

The location entity maps the information to geographically localize anything, it
is structured in a tree that contains all the imported countries on the root and
all the levels of data that [Geonames][4] can provide us.

**Fields**
- **Id:** The identifier **(Unique)**
- **Name:** The name. `e.g. Spain`
- **Code:** The code, usually the ISO code. `e.g. ES`
- **Type:** The type, from country on the root level to the lowest level. `e.g.
Country`

## Address

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Entity/Address.php)

The address entity provides a way to save a full address, it is thought to use
soft relations with locations to save the city and the postal code.

**Address Fields**
- **Id:** The identifier **(Unique)**
- **Name:** The address name, usually a name to identify the address from other
address. `e.g. My home`
- **Recipient name:** The name for the address recipient. `e.g. Homer`
- **Recipient surname:** The surname for the address recipient. `e.g. Simpson`
- **City:** The address city, usually a soft link to a location saving a
location id. `e.g. ES_CT_B_Barcelona`
- **Postal code**: The address postal code, usually a soft link to a location
saving a location id. `e.g. `
- **Address**: The city address. `e.g. C/ValÃ¨ncia 333`
- **Address more**: A second line to save the city address. `e.g. Baixos`
- **Phone**: An address phone number. `e.g. 958647856`
- **Mobile**: An address mobile phone number. `e.g. 648563258`
- **Comments**: An address comment, usually for the carrier. `e.g. It's an
office`
- **Created at**: The date time when the address was created. `e.g. 2015-03-05
12:52:20`
- **Updated at**: The date time when the address was updated. `e.g. 2015-03-05
12:52:20`
- **Enabled**: If the address is enabled. `e.g. 1`

# Service layer

## Formatter/AddressFormatter.php

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Formatter/AddressFormatter.php)

The address formatter provides various utilities to format an address.

**e.g.** *This service can be used to print the address in string format to do a
call to the Google Maps API*

## Services/AddressManager.php

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Services/AddressManager.php)

The address manager provides a safety way to save an address, it checks if the
address is being edited and in this case creates a copy so other entities that
could be using this address.

**e.g.** *This service is used when a customer is editing one of his existing
addresses to ensure that any older order keeps the right address*

## Services/LocationApiProvider.php

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Services/LocationApiProvider.php)

This service uses the Locations API to provide locations and their info (Root,
Childrens, Parents, hierarchy, etc.)

**e.g.** *This service is used to fill the location selectors on the forms to
add a new address*

## Services/LocationBuilder.php

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Services/LocationBuilder.php)

Builds a location given the location information

**e.g.** *This service is used to build location entities using the info
received by the locations API*

## Services/LocationServiceProvider.php

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Services/LocationServiceProvider.php)

This service uses the Locations repository to provide locations and their info
(Root, Childrens, Parents, hierarchy, etc.)

**e.g.** *This service is used to fill the location selectors on the forms to
add a new address*


# Event layer

## AddressOnCloneEvent

This event is launched every time that an address is cloned, that happens when
an address is being edited. We create a clone because other entities could be
pointing to this address. A copy is created while other entities can keep the
pointer to the old address.

**e.g.** *A customer edits his address but hi has old orders pointing to the
address being edited*

> More info about this on the
> [Services/AddressManager.php](#servicesaddressmanagerphp) section

# Controllers

## LocationApiController

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Controller/LocationApiController.php)

The location Api controller provides the actions needed to use the location
service as an API

# Commands

## LocationPopulateCommand

[View code](https://github.com/elcodi/Geo/blob/master/Command/LocationPopulateCommand.php)

``` bash
$ php app/console elcodi:locations:populate CountryIso
```

Populates the database with all the locations for the received country. It gets
all the data from [Geonames].

**Parameters:**
- CountryIso: The [ISO 3166-1 (Alpha-2 code)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) for the country
that you want to populate.
